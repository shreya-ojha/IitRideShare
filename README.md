RideShare IIT Indore is a web-based ride-sharing platform designed specifically for students at IIT Indore. The platform enables students to efficiently offer and request rides, allowing them to match with others traveling in the same direction and share the cost of travel. This application streamlines the ride coordination process and reduces transportation costs for students.

**Key Features:**

User Authentication: Secure login and registration system for students.
Ride Creation: Students can create rides by specifying the source, destination, time, number of available seats, and the cost per seat.
Ride Visibility: All rides created by students are visible to other IIT Indore students.
Ride History & Rating System: A history of past rides with a rating and review system for reliability and trust-building.
Ride Search: Users can search for available rides by destination, source, or both.
Join Ride Request: Users can request to join a ride, and the ride creator can accept or decline the request.
Route Suggestions (Optional): Integration of Google Maps API to suggest the best routes for rides.
Chat Feature (Optional): A messaging system to facilitate communication between ride creators and passengers.
